# 2D Platformer Game - Wizard Adventure

A 2D platformer built using the Godot game engine. This project demonstrates core gameplay mechanics like character movement, enemy interactions, and item collection. This project was for Game Programming (CSCI-374).

## Features
- **Classic Platformer Mechanics**: Walking, running, jumping, double-jumping, attacking, and platform-based obstacles.
- **Enemy AI**: Simple AI for enemies, providing challenges as the player progresses.
- **Collectibles**: Find items that increase your score, improve magic attacks, and allow level progression.
- **Life System**: You only get 3 lives before you need to start over.
- **High Score**: Keep track of your high score in the main menu.
- **Sound Effects & Music**: Immersive audio to complement gameplay.

## Goal
Explore the mystical landscape to collect 3 different colored gems and reveal a 4th gem that the player can obtain to complete the level. 
Use magic attacks to take out slimes in your way (Beware of the ones that drop from the ceiling!). 
Find books to strengthen your magic, allowing you to get through enemies that block the path forward.
